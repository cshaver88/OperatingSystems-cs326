Project 1: This is a doubly linked list that creates nodes for lines from a given input file. 
           Each line is sorted as it is added to the linked list. 
           If an output file is given the sorted list of nodes will output to that filename.
           
Project 2: Part A: Create my own version of the ls terminal command.
           Use readdir sys calls to list the contents of the current directory.
           List all files and directories on separate lines.
           Files that start with "." will not be listed.
           Part B: Implement pipe redirection ex: echo world hello | wc
           Support multiple arguments for file redirection as well as pipe redirection.
           Support output file redirection ex: echo hello world > hi.txt
           
Project 3: Modify the existing Operating System to accept and utilize the new commands created in the previous projects.

Project 4: Modified the existing Operating System to use the previous three projects and make them multi threaded.
